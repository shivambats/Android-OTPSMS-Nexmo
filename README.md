# Android-OTPSMS-Nexmo

Android project for sending OTP - SMS to the numbers through Nexmo SMS Getway. A 6 digit random number is created and is sent 
via internet using the Nexmo SMS Getway. All the messages sent are stored and shown in the messages screen by the last sent
order.

Change the api_key from Nexmo in Sendmessage.java wit the secret_key. Also if the Nexmo account is for testing, make sure the 
number you are sending the message to is added in the test users.
